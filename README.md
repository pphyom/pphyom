<!-- ![About Me](readme_header.png) -->

## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, people!

As a Computer Science graduate with hands-on experience as a Production Engineer at Supermicro, I offer a unique intersection of software development knowledge and real-world engineering expertise. My academic foundation in algorithms, system design, and problem-solving has enabled me to drive improvements in manufacturing efficiency and product quality in a fast-paced tech environment.

### Academic Background

I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science, where I developed strong skills in programming, data structures, networking, and analytical thinking. This education laid the groundwork for my ability to design and implement practical software solutions to real-world engineering challenges.

### Professional Experience

During my time at Supermicro, I worked as a Production Engineer, where I focused on optimizing manufacturing processes, deploying automation solutions, and upholding high standards of quality control. I collaborated with cross-functional teamsâ€”including *R&D*, *QA*, and *supply chain*â€”to support continuous improvement efforts across the production pipeline.

For my capstone project, I developed a web-based data visualization and management tool tailored for manufacturing workflows. This application was designed to:
- Summarize daily test data from AI-optimized servers,
- Manage firmware upgrades/downgrades for BIOS, BMC, and drivers,
- Run and debug third-party utilities (e.g., IPMI tools) for remote server control.
This project sparked a deep interest in building software that bridges the gap between engineering operations and digital solutions.


### Passion and Vision

I am passionate about using technology to solve complex, real-world problems and enhance operational efficiency. As I continue to grow as a Software Development Engineer, my goal is to contribute to innovation in production systems and help shape the future of the tech industry.
