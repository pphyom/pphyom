<!-- ![About Me](readme_header.png) -->

## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, people!

As a Computer Science graduate and a former Production Engineer at Supermicro, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and hands-on engineering experience to the field of computer manufacturing. My academic background has provided me with a foundation in software development, algorithms, system design, troubleshooting, and problem-solving, which I have successfully applied to optimize production processes and enhance product quality in my previous role.

### Academic Background

I graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science that I honed my skills in programming, data structures, computer networking, problem-solving, and critical thinking.

### Professional Experience

At Supermicro, I served as a Production Engineer, where I focused on streamlining manufacturing workflows, implementing automation solutions, and ensuring the highest standard of product quality. I worked closely with cross-functional teams, including R&D, quality assurance, and supply chain management, to drive continuous improvement initiatives.

My capstone project involved developing a data visualization and summarization web app that can be used 
- to summarize the daily test data of AI-driven servers,
- to upgrade/downgrade software such as BIOS, BMC, and other firmware,
- to run and debug various utility tools such as IPMI tools and etc.., to control computer servers remotely in one place
for manufacturing daily workflow, which sparked my interest in integrating software solutions.


### Passion and Vision

I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems and to improve workplace's efficiency. My goal is to continue growing as a SDE, driving innovation in the production processes, and contributing to the advancement of the computer industry.
